# IOS-Swift-AddPullToRefresh
``` Level : Intermediate ```

A UIRefreshControl object provides a standard control that can be used to initiate the refreshing of a table view’s contents. When pulled,  a little wheel starts spinning at the top, until the refresh has completed.  At that time, the wheel disappears, and the view bounces back into place. In this tutorial a refresh control will be added to a table view. When the control is pulled the sorting order of the rows will be reversed. This tutorial is made with Xcode 9 and built for iOS 11.
